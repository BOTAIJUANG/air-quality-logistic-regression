This repository contains the R code I used in the IJC437 Applied Data Science Course Project. 
This project analyses the daily PM2.5 concentration in London and explores whether meteorological 
conditions are related to the occurrence of high pollution days.


## Data
- PM2.5 data: OpenAQ API (v3), four London monitoring stations
- Weather data: Open-Meteo Archive API
- Study period: 1 January to 1 July 2025

## How to run

The analysis was carried out in R.  
The main steps of the analysis are implemented in R scripts located in the `code` folder.
To reproduce the analysis, open the scripts in order and run them sequentially in R or RStudio.

## Findings

The analysis results showed that there was a significant change in the daily PM2.5 concentration during the study period. 
High pollution days usually occur in unfavourable meteorological conditions, especially in low wind speeds. 
These findings show that meteorological conditions play a certain role in the short-term PM2.5 pollution level in London.
